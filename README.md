# RSA
This is project in resource allocation for computer networks with heuristic and reinforcement learning methods.

## Reinforcement
The file netenv.py defines the network environment for reinforcement. The file myrun.py registers this environment and then defines 2 algorithms to view the results.

## Heuristic
The file networkmodel.py defines the heuristic model
